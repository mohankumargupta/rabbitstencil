# Rabbit Stencil

![Rabbit stencil](https://github.com/mohankumargupta/rabbitstencil/raw/master/rabbit-stencil.jpg)

Used to have a bunch of them when I was a kid.

Like to be able to recreate them, now that we have 3d printing technology readily available.

My new idea is to create a script in OpenSCAD that:

1. Takes a SVG of the animal you want on the stencil (need to work out what the right size should be)
2. Build the stencil automatically and produce STL at the end.
